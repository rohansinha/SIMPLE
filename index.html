A simple, yet sophisticated idea...  </p>

<a name="about-simple" class="anchor" href="#about-simple"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About SIMPLE</h3>

<p>We all spend hours listening to music, whether it be while travelling, exercising, relaxing, studying, or just to listen. But no matter how may apps we download, what all features our music players have, no music player can do what this one can.<br>
SIMPLE is here to be your new best friend.<br>
In certain situations we feel like listening to a specific set of songs. More often than not, we have a bunch of playlists for our various moods and activities.<br>
Now imagine if you never had to bother with playlists. Imagine a music player that knows what you want to hear, and when you want to hear it. Imagine never having to make another playlist. Imagine not having to reach for your phone to pick a song because you don't feel like listening to what's playing.<br><strong>Meet SIMPLE</strong><br>
An idea that will allow you to just pick a song. Once*. After that, the player will know what you want to hear. You will never have to bother with playlists or constantly changing tracks again. Once SIMPLE is trained well enough, it will play what you want without being told. It will learn you. Know you. Understand you. And if it ever makes a mistake, just correcting it will improve its understanding of you.  </p>

<p>So, are you ready to meet SIMPLE?    </p>
